The Ka‘ū Forest Reserve was established by Governor’s Proclamation on August 2, 1906 to protect the forest on the lower slopes of Mauna Loa in the Ka‘ū District on the southeastern side of the island of Hawai‘i. The Reserve is public land, managed by DOFAW, and consists of approximately 61,000 acres of forested lands. Ka‘ū Forest Reserve was established to maintain the necessary water supply for agricultural lands in Ka‘ū.

The Ka‘ū Forest Reserve is a critical watershed for the people of Ka‘ū. The forest reserve’s water sources are used for domestic supplies as well as agriculture, and maintaining this water supply is important for the future viability of agriculture in Ka‘?. The native forest replenishes springs and other groundwater, and reduces flooding and erosion.

The Ka‘ū Forest Reserve is important for preserving Hawaii’s unique native forest ecosystems and its species, including a wide variety of rare or endangered plants and animals. Endangered birds for which the continuing health of the forest reserve may be a critical factor include the ‘Akiapōlā‘au (Hemignathus munroi), Hawai‘i Creeper (Oreomystis mana) and Hawai‘i ‘Akepa (Loxops coccineus).

The Ka‘ū Forest Reserve contains resources that are vital for maintaining Hawaiian culture and practices. Hawaiians consider native plants and animals as family and have a strong spiritual connection to the mountain landscape and the forest itself.
