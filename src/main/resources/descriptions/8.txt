Lapakahi State Historical Park is a large area of ruins from an Ancient Hawaiian fishing village in the North Kohala District on the Big Island of Hawaiʻi.[2][3] Offshore is the Lapakahi Marine Life Conservation District.

The name lapa kahi means "single ridge" in the Hawaiian Language, and applied to the ahupuaʻa, an ancient land division that ran from the sea up to Kohala Mountain.[4] It is located off of ʻAkoni Pule Highway (Route 270), 12.4 miles (20.0 km) north of Kawaihae, Hawaii.[5] It is state archaeological site 10-02-2245,[6] and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 2, 1973 as site 73000654.[1] Just to the north, Māhukona Beach Park is on a bay where a sugar mill once stood.[7]
