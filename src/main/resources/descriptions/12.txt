Kipahoehoe Natural Area Reserve is a narrow piece of land running down the southwest slopes of Mauna Loa in the district of South Kona. It includes a rare lowland grassland, as well as mesic and wet forests of `ohi`a and koa. Recent volcanic flows run through the Reserve, leaving a variety of different aged communities.
