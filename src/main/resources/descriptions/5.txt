The Mauna Kea Observatories (MKO) are a number of independent astronomical research facilities and large telescope observatories that are located at the summit of Mauna Kea on the Big Island of Hawai ªi, United States. The facilities are located in a 525-acre (212 ha) special land use zone known as the "Astronomy Precinct", which is located within the 11,228-acre (4,544 ha) Mauna Kea Science Reserve.[1] The Astronomy Precinct was established in 1967 and is located on land protected by the Historical Preservation Act for its significance to Hawaiian culture.

The location is near ideal because of its:

dark skies from lack of light pollution,
good astronomical seeing,
low humidity,
high altitude of 4,205 meters (13,796 ft),
position above most of the water vapor in the atmosphere,
clean air,
good weather and
low latitude location.[2]
