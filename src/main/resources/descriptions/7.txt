Halaʻula is within the Bond District, a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. It includes the 19th century Bond House, also named Iole after its location, and a part of the homestead of missionaries Ellen and Reverend Elias Bond. The nucleus of this rambling New England dwelling was built in 1840 by the Rev. Isaac Bliss who was assisted by a carpenter from Honolulu. First occupied in January 1841, it was of "native wood and plaster on stone foundation with a good cellar."

Assigned to the Kohala Station in June 1841, Rev. and Mrs. Elias Bond moved into the thatched mission house. Mr. Bond described the first addition in 1842: "Our dwelling house is 40 feet long by 36 feet wide. The study and native room are 21 feet by 24 feet."

Through the years the home was expanded and modified to accommodate several generations who lived under its roof. Lived in until 1930, it is now kept as a family retreat with all its old furnishings. Surrounded by the original outbuildings, the Bond House remains the last mission complex still intact in Hawaiʻi.
